# Overview

`npx skills add <source> --skill <name> ...` installs selected skills into
whichever agent directories a repository uses, and accepts a **local path** as
the source - which is what makes it usable as a pre-publication check.

That local-source support is why `scripts/smoke-test-install.sh` can exercise
the real install path in CI against the checked-out branch, in a throwaway
consumer repository, before any change reaches a published release.

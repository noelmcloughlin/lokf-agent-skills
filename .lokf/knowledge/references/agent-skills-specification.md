# Overview

Defines the unit this repository distributes. Each skill is a directory with a
case-exact `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter carries `name` (matching the directory)
and `description`; supporting files may sit alongside it and travel with the
directory when installed.

Two consequences shape the layout here: the `description` is always resident in
the calling agent's context, so it is kept near 100 words, while the body loads
only on trigger - which is why each `SKILL.md` is a lean router and detail
lives in `references/`. `gh skill publish --dry-run` validates conformance in
CI on every pull request.

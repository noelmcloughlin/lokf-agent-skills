# Overview

The site is the authority for what LOKF *means*: the Golden Rules the
librarian skill carries, the type vocabulary, the typed-relation predicates,
and the trust families. The format itself is defined once in LinkML
(`lokf.yaml`); the JSON Schema, JSON-LD context, SHACL shapes, and OWL
ontology are all **generated** from it and must not be hand-edited.

Distinct from the [toolkit](lokf-toolkit.md) that implements it: the site
defines meaning, the PyPI package does the validating and projecting. The
skills cite each for its own role.

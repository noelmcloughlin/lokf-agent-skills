# Overview

Added in GitHub CLI v2.90.0. `gh skill install <repo> <skill[@version]>`
installs one skill at a time into a host-specific directory, at project or
user scope, with `--pin` for a tag or commit SHA; there is no cross-skill
dependency mechanism, which is why this repository documents installing each
of the four explicitly.

`gh skill publish` validates the repository's skills against the Agent Skills
specification and creates the tag and GitHub release. `--dry-run` is the
validation-only mode CI runs on every pull request; `--tag vX.Y.Z` is the
non-interactive publish the release workflow calls.

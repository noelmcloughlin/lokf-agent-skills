# Overview

Every LOKF bundle is also a valid OKF bundle. OKF supplies the substrate the
skills depend on: one concept per file with path as concept ID, `type` as the
only strictly required field, and permissive consumption - unknown types,
unknown keys, and broken cross-links must never cause rejection.

Sections 5.1-5.5 define the trust vocabulary this repository's whole thesis
rests on: `sources` and `generated` (provenance), `verified` (trust events),
`status` and `stale_after` (lifecycle), and section 5.3's trust tiers - derived
from the actor strings, never stored. Section 7 fixes the actor convention
(`human:<id>`, `process:<id>`, `<producer>/<version>`) that makes
"confirmed by a person" a machine-checkable distinction.

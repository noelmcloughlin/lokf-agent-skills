# Overview

A person no longer hand-picks the version, but two tools never race to tag
it. `semantic-release.yml`'s `release` job runs on every push to `main`,
behind the `release` GitHub Environment: `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`
computes the next version from Conventional Commits since the last tag, and
`@semantic-release/exec` runs `.github/scripts/changelog-release.mjs`
`--dry-run` only - refusing to proceed if `CHANGELOG.md`'s
`## [Unreleased]` section is empty - which means semantic-release itself
never writes, commits, tags, or publishes anything here. A plain shell step
afterward reads the version `--dry-run` computed, promotes that section to a
dated heading itself, and commits the change directly - `gh skill publish`
stays this repository's one and only tag creator, per the reasoning below.

Releases are still never tag-triggered. `gh skill publish` creates the tag
*and* the GitHub release itself, so a tag-push trigger would race the tag the
command is about to create; `workflow_dispatch` keeps the timing an explicit
human decision, and the `release` environment adds a maintainer-approval gate
in front of the `contents: write` scope - the same Environment
`semantic-release.yml`'s write-scoped job now sits behind too.

Each `publish.yml` run validates that the input is `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, that
the tag does not already exist, and - new - that the bare version matches
CHANGELOG.md's top heading (catching a typed version nobody wrote release
notes for), then re-runs the repository contract and `gh skill publish
--dry-run`, and only then publishes. All four skills ship together under one
tag, so a consumer can pin them to a single release.

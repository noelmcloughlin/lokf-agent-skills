# Overview

Runs **whenever anyone asks**. Bundle first: read `knowledge/index.md`, open
one to three candidate concepts, widen along typed relations rather than by
grepping, and verify exact values (versions, endpoints, paths) at the
concept's `resource` before stating them. Every answer carries a footing -
which concepts it rests on and how far each has been trusted.

It is **read-only on `knowledge/`**. Its single write is `.lokf/feedback.md`,
after asking once per session: a **Miss** (a question the bundle could not
answer, plus where the answer was found) or a **Disagreement** (a concept
versus what its source now says). The librarian consumes and clears those
entries on its next run, which closes the loop from reader back to bundle.

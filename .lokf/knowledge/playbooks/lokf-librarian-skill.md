# Overview

Runs **often**, including on a schedule. It carries the seven LOKF Golden Rules
(OKF-first; the bundle-root semantic header and `base_iri` authority test; the
15-class type vocabulary plus the Diátaxis `genre` facet; typed relationships
over bare links; core field-to-ontology mapping; trust, provenance and
lifecycle; permissiveness), then four sections: scrape and build, audit,
hand off for review, and the scheduled task.

It deals in **facts about the repository, never verdicts about truth**: it may
record that it re-checked a concept against its source (`verified` by
`process:lokf-librarian`), but only [lokf-curator](lokf-curator-skill.md)
writes a `human:` confirmation. Concepts it creates start as `status: draft`,
and a claim it cannot settle gets an `## Open questions` section instead of a
guess.

Two things it now leaves alone by rule (added 2026-09-12): the Obsidian
affordances LOKF Registrar may write into a bundle - a marker-delimited
`<!-- lokf:related -->` block in a concept body and a `diataxis.md` Map of
Content (`type: Document`, `generated.by: lokf-registrar/<version>`, or
`lokf-enforcer/<version>` from a build before the plugin's rename), which it
never edits, lists, audits as orphans, or counts - and the bundle's second
name: in lokf-sidecar's visible layout `.lokf/knowledge` is a link onto
`knowledge_bundle/`, so it addresses the bundle by the tools' name and names
both paths when scoping a diff or a PR.

The tooling-version check (rule 6) now runs **only in interactive
sessions**: the scheduled workflow's wrapper permits edits solely under
`.lokf/knowledge/`, `knowledge_bundle/` and `.lokf/feedback.md`, so a
scheduled run that touched `.lokf/pyproject.toml` would fail the whole run
closed rather than land a partial change - added 2026-09-12 as part of a
security-hardening pass that also added a second, independent enforcement
of that same path boundary in `knowledge-librarian.yaml`'s privileged
`publish` job (re-derived from the proposed patch on a clean checkout,
never trusting the `refresh` job's own check alone), plus harden-runner and
`.git/config`/`.git/hooks/` snapshot-and-restore around the agent call in
the wrapper script. See `policies/security.md` for the detail.

# Overview

The labels restate OKF section 5.3's trust tiers in words a non-specialist can
act on. They are computed each time from `verified`, `status`, `generated.at`,
and `stale_after`: any `verified` actor prefixed `human:` means confirmed by a
person; events by non-human actors only mean checked by automation; no
`verified` key at all means nobody has checked it.

They deliberately overlap - a concept can be confirmed *and* past its review
date - so the counts in a curator report are not a partition. Nothing is
scored and nothing is stored: a score would be subjective, unportable, and
would go stale.

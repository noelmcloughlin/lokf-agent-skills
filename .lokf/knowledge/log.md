# Change Log

## 2026-09-09

* **Initialization**: Scaffolded the LOKF bundle for LOKF Agent Skills, then
  ran a bootstrap discovery pass over the repository. Populated it with 25
  concepts: 8 playbooks (the four skills, the source map, contributing,
  releasing, repository validation), 7 references (the LOKF, OKF and Agent
  Skills specifications, the lokf toolkit, LinkML, and the two installer
  CLIs), 4 glossary terms, 4 policies, and 2 explanations. `base_iri` is a
  placeholder (`lokf-agent-skills.example`) pending a namespace the project
  controls.
* **Removed**: the scaffolded `services/` directory and its two dummy
  concepts - this repository ships documentation, agent skills, and CI, and
  has no `Service`, `Dataset`, `Table`, or `Metric` assets to describe.

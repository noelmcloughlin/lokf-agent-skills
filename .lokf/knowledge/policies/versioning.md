# Overview

`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Patch is a correction that does not materially change
expected behaviour; minor is a backward-compatible addition or a broader
supported workflow; major is a breaking change to behaviour, structure,
assumptions, or interoperability.

All four skills ship from one tag rather than versioning independently,
because they are designed as a set - the librarian hands off to the curator,
the docent records feedback the librarian consumes - and a consumer pinning
them to different releases could pair skills that disagree about the
frontmatter contract between them.

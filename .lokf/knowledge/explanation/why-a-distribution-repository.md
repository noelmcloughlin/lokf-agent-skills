# Overview

The skills began embedded in a project that used them, which meant every other
repository wanting them had to copy directories by hand - and copies drift.
A dedicated repository makes them installable (`gh skill install`,
`npx skills add`), pinnable to a release, and reviewable in one place with a
single changelog.

This repository is the sole canonical source. Other projects, including the one
the skills originated in, consume the published release like any other user
rather than maintaining a parallel copy - which is also why this bundle exists:
the repository dogfoods its own skills on itself.

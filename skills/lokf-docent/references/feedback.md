# `.lokf/feedback.md` - reader feedback for the librarian

Written by lokf-docent, consumed and cleared by lokf-librarian on its next run. It lives at `.lokf/feedback.md` - **beside** `knowledge/`, never inside
it - because it is input to the bundle, not part of it. It has no frontmatter and is not a concept.

## Before writing

Ask once per session, in plain words: "Record bundle gaps in `.lokf/feedback.md` for the librarian?" Remember the answer for the rest of
the session. If no, say the gap out loud in your answer and write nothing. If `.lokf/` is read-only, don't ask - just say the gap.

A gitignored `.lokf/` is still writable: record the feedback, but say that the scheduled librarian loop doesn't run in that mode, so someone has to run
lokf-librarian by hand for it to be consumed.

## Format

Create the file with the heading if it doesn't exist. Newest date first; one entry per line; bold kind first. Attribute as `docent`, plus the asker's
`human:<id>` only if it is already known (a GitHub login or `git config user.name` slug - never an email).

```markdown
# Reader feedback for the librarian

Written by lokf-docent; consumed and cleared by lokf-librarian on its next run. Newest first. One line per entry.

## 2026-09-08

- **Miss** - Q: "Which queue does the billing worker consume?" Answered from `workers/billing/config.yaml` (queue `billing-events`). Suggest: a Service concept for the billing worker, `dependsOn` the events dataset. - docent, for human:ada-lovelace
- **Disagreement** - `services/orders-api.md` says endpoint `/v1/orders`; `services/orders/openapi.yaml` now says `/v2/orders`. Answered from the source. - docent
```

### A Miss

The question the bundle could not answer, **where you found the answer** (the repository path or URL - this is what lets the librarian derive the concept directly instead of rediscovering it), and, if obvious, what kind of concept it would be and what it relates to. If you couldn't find the answer
either, say so: the librarian will create a draft placeholder carrying the question, and a person will see it in the curator's queue.

### A Disagreement

The concept (path), what it says, what its source says instead, and which one you answered from. Don't guess *why* they differ - the librarian checks
whether the repository simply moved on (fix the concept) or whether the matter is genuinely unsettled (set `draft`, add an open question for the
curator).

## What not to record

- Questions the bundle answered fine.
- Things a future reader would not plausibly ask again.
- Anything about the bundle's *tooling* (a broken `justfile`, a missing `pyproject.toml`) - that is lokf-sidecar's repair path, not knowledge
  feedback.
- Your opinion of a concept. If you think it is wrong but the source agrees with it, it isn't a Disagreement; say your doubt in the answer and leave the bundle alone.

## What happens next

lokf-librarian reads this file first on every steady-state refresh (its section 1): a Miss becomes a concept derived from the source you named, or a
`status: draft` placeholder with the question under `## Open questions`; a Disagreement becomes a corrected concept or a `draft` with both versions
recorded for lokf-curator. Handled entries are removed. The scheduled workflow commits `feedback.md` together with `knowledge/`, so consumed
entries don't come back. The curator's report shows how many entries are waiting, so a person can see that readers are finding gaps.
